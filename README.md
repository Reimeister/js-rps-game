# js-rps-game

This is my first program from scratch using Javascript.
My goals are:
1. To use my existing knowledge to create an algorithm
2. To use outside tools to fill in the gaps of my knowledge
3. To create something that surpasses my expectations for my first simple project.
4. To create room for a UI later on.
